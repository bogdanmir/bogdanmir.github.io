These markups cover the costs for wholesalers, <span class="text_hidden">distributors, retailers, and expensive advertising campaigns.<br> We started Filippo Loreti because like lots of guys out there we were frustrated with steep and unjustified prices of high-quality watches. Filippo Loreti fixes that, with fair prices, no upcharges, and no gimmicks. We do things differently. By using a disruptive, direct-to-consumer model we cut out distributors, wholesalers, and retail stores. This way, by avoiding all the middlemen we can offer you a limited edition luxury watch for less than $300.</span></p>      <div class="sales_btn_holder"><span class="sales_toggle_btn read_more"></span></div> </div></div>');
